     Allow overriding the default shipped config for cTAKES.

     The intended flow is to directly mount a file as "/overrides/symptoms.bsv",
     or instead mount a whole directory as "/overrides".
     A docker mount like: type=bind,src=./custom.bsv,dst=/overrides/symptoms.bsv,ro

     More allowed overrides might happen in the future, but this is what we support today.

     I tried adding a WatchedResource for this file, to avoid having to restart the container.
     But something about cTAKES really did not like that, and it kept crashing upon restart.
     Instead, we use a script (restart-on-change) to watch the file for us.

     See https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/config/resources.html for how the config works.
